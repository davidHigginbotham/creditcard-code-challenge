Here is the code challenge. You don’t need to write a user interface or anything, the tests running is all that is needed to “prove” the example.
While this can be done very simply, we are really looking for how you solve problems in an object oriented way.  Try to use the OOP principles as you work through this example.

To write a simple java program that calculates Credit Card interest for a Person.

Visa  get 10%
MC  get 5% interest
Discover  get 1% interest

Each Card Type can have multiple cards and there can be multiple Wallets for a Person.

NOTE:  SIMPLE INTEREST for this test case (means 1 month of interest,  if the interest rate is 10% and the amount is 100.00 – interest in this case would be 10.00)
Here are the test Cases

1 person has 1 wallet and 3 cards (1 Visa, 1 MC 1 Discover) – Each Card has a balance of $100 – calculate the total interest(simple interest) for this person and per card.
1 person has 2 wallets  Wallet 1 has a Visa and Discover , wallet 2 a MC -  each card has $100 balance - calculate the total interest(simple interest) for this person and interest per wallet
2 people have 1 wallet each,  person 1 has 1 wallet , with 2 cards MC and visa person 2 has 1 wallet – 1 visa and 1 MC -  each card has $100 balance - calculate the total interest(simple interest) for each person and interest per wallet
